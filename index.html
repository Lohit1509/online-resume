    <p>
      I 'm honest, driven and strong willed individual who is willing to take
      responsibilities and enjoy assimilating new knowledge. A dog lover who
      always try to help others and prefer to show who I'm in real. This is what
      I feel is my weakness as sometimes it is not likeable by people to be
      straight forward.
